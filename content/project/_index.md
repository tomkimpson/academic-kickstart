Throughout my research I have written a number of scientific codes, typically relating to time-frequency modelling and signal analysis of non-linear, dynamical astrophysical systems. In order to enable [reproducible research](http://reproducibleresearch.net/) I am attempting to make all codes associated with published papers publicly available with documentation. This endeavour is currently a work in progress!
