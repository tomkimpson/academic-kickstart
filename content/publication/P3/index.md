abstract: "Radio timing observations of a millisecond pulsar in orbit around the Galactic centre black hole (BH) or a BH at the centre of globular clusters could answer foundational questions in astrophysics and fundamental physics. Pulsar radio astronomy typically employs the post-Keplerian approximation to determine the system parameters. However, in the strong gravitational field around the central BH, higher order relativistic effects may become important. We compare the pulsar timing delays given by the post-Keplerian approximation with those given by a relativistic timing model. We find significant discrepancies between the solutions derived for the Einstein delay and the propagation delay (i.e. Roemer and Sharpiro delay) compared to the fully relativistic solutions. Correcting for these higher order relativistic effects is essential in order to construct accurate radio timing models for pulsar systems at the Galactic centre and the centre of globular clusters and informing issues related to their detection."
